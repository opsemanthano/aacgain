This document describes how to build AACGAIN on a Linux system.
Please also read aacgain's original README.

As I am a noob concerning automake and stuff, please don't bash me if this build system
doesn't work properly. You can contact me (prakashpub at arcor dot de) if you have
concrete suggestions to enhance it.


=- Quick Steps -=

All paths are relative to the linux dir, where the prepare.sh script resides.

1) Extract needed code into the following dirs (paths are relative to this linux dir):
   ../aacgain
   ../mp3gain
   ../faad2* (from cvs September 2004 or later, don't use standard distribution <- important!)
   ../mpeg4ip*

In the end you should have following structure:

- linux
- mp3gain
- aacgain
- faad2*
- mpeg4ip*

2) Apply ../aacgain/mpeg4ip12.patch if necessary (refer to aacgain's README).

3) Run prepare.sh. This will create symlinks to the latest created
   fadd2* and mpeg4ip* directories. Use "touch" to get the correct directories
   selected.

4) Run mkdir build && cd build && ../configure --enable-static-build && make
   If you have faad2 and mp4v2 already installed, you may drop
   the --enable-static-build parameter to save compile time and binary size

5) I haven't tried "make install" on my system, so I cannor predict its behaviour.
   You can find the generated binary in build/aacgain/aacgain.
   Once compilation is finished you can reduce its size by running strip -s on it.
   
   I haven't thouroughly tested the generated binary, so take care.
   Tested on gentoo system with gcc-4 snapshot from 02.04.2004.
   
   Have fun!

Here's a list of things that the authors are working on in the short-term:

* mp4live:
	nothing for the moment

* mp4player:
        nothing for the moment

Here's a list of things that we would like to do in the future,
however we're happy to have volunteers do them also ;-)

* Support for DV in mp4live
* rewrite player to use timescales for synchronization
* Update ISO MPEG-4 reference codec to latest version
* RTP insertion/failover intermediary
* RSVP support
* Port, port, port...

Further suggestions are of course welcome, 
especially if you're willing to implement them!
